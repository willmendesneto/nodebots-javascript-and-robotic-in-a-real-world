This book is for anyone who wants to take the first steps on Nodebots or who already worked with. Their contents will be shown with simple and low cost sensors some pain points on the real integrations of a Nodebot application, such as integration between external APIs from events reading some sensor data, as well as good practices in how to use automation for validations, tests, builds metrics and more.
