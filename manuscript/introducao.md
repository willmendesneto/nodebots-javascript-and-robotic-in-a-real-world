# Introduction

This book is for anyone who wants to take the first steps on Nodebots or has an interest in deliving into some concepts that are poorly demonstrated on the subject.

It will be shown contents with simple and low-cost sensors, however relating the sensors with real integrations of a nodebots application, such as integration between external APIs from events reading some sensor data, among others.

In addition, the book is covering important topics in the test questions, showing good practices for testing coverage and how to test with quality and performance, with integrations in external services for automation of code quality and *build* validation tasks.

Another point is the evolution of the application with a focus on the architecture itself. How to use software architecture standards in any type of project and how to take advantage of each of them applying to your system.
