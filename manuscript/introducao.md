# Introduction

This part of the book is aimed at anyone who wants to take the first steps on Nodebots or who has an interest in delving into some concepts that are poorly demonstrated on the subject.

It will be shown contents with simple and low cost sensors, however relating the sensors with real integrations of a nodebots application, such as integration between external APIs from events reading some sensor data, among others.

I would like to publicly share my thanks to Nelson Glauber and Fagner Brack for their support in reviewing the contents of this book. Your help was fundamental to this work.
