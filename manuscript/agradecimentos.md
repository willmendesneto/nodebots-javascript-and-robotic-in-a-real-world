# Acknowledgements

I would like to thank initially my mother (who has played the role of mother and father for many times), this wonderful person who taught me many of the values ​​and that I take with me to this day, being my example to this day. Marco Marocci and Robson Mário, who are like parents to me and my brother Leonardo Araújo who was always with me when I needed and who also gave me 2 brothers, Ramon Pombo and Matheus Pombo.

I would like to thank my wife, Nilana Rocha, for all her support. It was one of the crucial factors and without a doubt this book would not be a reality. Thank you so much for everything.

A great time to remember all my friends from the LinguÁgil Group and #horaExtraSSA from Salvador-BA. You were people who motivated me to be the professional that I am today that motivated me to seek and share knowledge. Thank you all. To the people of Recife who are very affectionate people and presented me with cheese curd, macaxeira (or aipim?) And much affection.

Finally, I would like to thank [Nelson Glauber](https://twitter.com/nglauber) and [Fagner Brack](https://twitter.com/fagnerbrack) for their support in reviewing the contents of this book and for everyone who Have contributed directly or indirectly to the composition of this book, such as [Rafael Gomes](https://twitter.com/gomex), [Juliano Bersano](https://twitter.com/julianobersano), [Sarah Atkinson](https://twitter.com/SarahvAko) and several others who supported me in this process and suggested improvements at this stage.
