## Protoboard

When you need to quickly and temporarily prototype a circuit, you are using a protoboard.

Protoboard are boards that can simulate electronic component connections. It has small holes,
Delivering your wires


## Piezo

Piezo is a sensor that emits a beep, such as a horn. This signal can be created in an application Nodebots from a numeric value or an abstraction of sound notes, which makes their manipulation simpler.


## Resistors

The resistors are widely used in electronics, send one of the first electronic components with which
And one of the most used. They are small enough in pill form with stripes in most cases.
circuit boards.

A resistor is an electronic component that limits the flow of electrons dissipating energy in the form of heat, since the
Electricity has to struggle to flow through something with a high resistance. Using a large amount of energy and converting it into heat.


## LED (Light-emitting diode)

LED is an abbreviation for LED (Light-emitting diode). A light emitting diode type component.


## Sensors

A device that converts real-world (analog) data into data that a computer can understand using
ADC and converting data from Analog to Digital format. We will use sensors to detect events or
Site and we will send it for you to read in our application.


## Protective Conductor (Ground or Ground Wire)

It is the input wire of an electric conductor that has the function of "grounding" all the devices that need
Use its potential as a reference or its electrical properties.

In power systems, the earth has the functions of electrical reference for voltage, protection systems, control for overload/power and equipment protection.
