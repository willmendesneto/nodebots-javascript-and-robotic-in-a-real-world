# Next steps

Finishing now the contents of this book with some rather didactic examples we already see the power of Javascript allied to robotics in our applications. These are examples that can be incorporated into our daily lives and teachings to carry out various other ideas that will arise.

I hope you have enjoyed the contents of this book and the examples as much as I have had the pleasure of sharing this content. If you have questions, questions or even a conversation, please contact us at `willmendesneto@gmail.com`.

Thank you very much!
